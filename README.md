##  Problem statement:  
The problem is that most people probably have a hard time deciding what to wear and when, what goes together, whether it looks good or not, and whether it matches their body shape or not Also, many e-commerce fashion platforms struggle to deliver personalized recommendations and styling options that align with individual preferences and body types. This lack of personalization often leads to frustration and inefficiency in finding clothing that suits the user's unique style, resulting in a less satisfying shopping experience.
